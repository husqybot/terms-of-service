If you do not agree with these terms, you may not use Husqy.

## 1. Acceptance of Terms

By adding Huqsy to, or, using Husqy in a Discord server, you acknowledge and agree to these Terms of Service. The server administrator is responsible for ensuring that all members who interact with the bot are aware of and comply with these terms.

These terms apply to all users, including but not limited to server owners, administrators, and individual members.

## 2. License and Bot Usage

Husqy is provided to you under a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, and revocable license to use the bot for its intended purpose. You agree that:

- You will not attempt to exploit, abuse, or disrupt the bot or its services.

We reserve the right to restrict or terminate your access to the bot at any time if you violate these terms or if we detect misuse.

Any misuse of the bot will result in immediate removal and potential reporting to Discord.

## 4. Bot Functionality

Husqy is provided on an **"as-is"** and **"as-available"** basis. While we strive to maintain reliable functionality, we do not guarantee that the bot will always be operational or free of errors.

- This includes any loss of data, server disruptions, or damage to your Discord server, account, or related services.

You use the bot at your own risk, and we provide no warranty or guarantee of service.

## 7. Termination of Service

We reserve the right to terminate or suspend access to Husqy for any reason, including but not limited to:
